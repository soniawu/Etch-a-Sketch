Odin Project Etch-a-Sketch

Version 1:
    - Create a 16X16 grid of square divs
      Use flex display to layout grids as a square.
      Use border on each grid to show lines.
    - Set up a mouse over (hover) effect so that the grid divs change to red when your mouse passes over them.
    - All above are managed by javascripts.

Version 2:
    - Add user input to the page for the number of grids per side
    - js script draws grids on the 960px X 960px div base on the input number
